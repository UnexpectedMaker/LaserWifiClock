It's custom hardware and custom code but all open source so if you want the challenge of making one yourself or you want to hack the code, go for it!

I have a live stream build of the board here if you want to see what's involved:

# Design Files
Inlcluded in this reposity:
- EagleCAD schematics and Board layout files (Eagle 9.2) 
- Exported Gerber files (Gerber 274X)
- STL & DXF files for the 3D printed case and laser cut pieces
- Adrduino code

# Assembling the case
Here is a video guide to assembling the case

# Hacking the code
You will need to have the ESP8266 board for Arduino IDE installed. If you don't, you can follow the instructions here:
https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0-beta2/installing.html

Once installed you'll need to select the *LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & Mini* as the board type.

Plus the following libraries from Library Manager
- One Button
- TimeLib
- WifiManager (tzapu)
- ArduinoJson

Enjoy!
