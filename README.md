It's custom hardware and custom code but all open source so if you want the challenge of making one yourself or you want to hack the code, go for it!

I have a live stream build of the board here if you want to see what's involved:

# Design Files
Inlcluded in this reposity:
- EagleCAD schematics and Board layout files (Eagle 9.2) 
- Exported Gerber files (Gerber 274X)
- STL & DXF files for the 3D printed case and laser cut pieces
- Adrduino code

# Hacking the code
You will need to have the ESP8266 board for Arduino IDE installed. If you don't, you can follow the instructions here:
https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0-beta2/installing.html

Once installed you'll need to select the *LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & Mini* as the board type.

Plus the following libraries from Library Manager
- One Button
- TimeLib
- WifiManager (tzapu)
- ArduinoJson

   
Enjoy!

# Back me on Patreon?
I love making and designing projects but sharing open source projects takes a lot of thought and time. I do it because I think it’s important to share knowledge and give back to the community like many have done before me.

If you find this project useful or want to see more open source projects like it, please consider backing me on Patreon to say thanks!
